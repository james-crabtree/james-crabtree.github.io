    <h1 class="text">About Me</h1> 
    <p class="text"> Hello there everyone! Welcome to my blog. My name is James Crabtree, I'm 23 years old and was born in a small quiet town in the south of England called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Tunbridge_Wells">Royal Tunbridge Wells</a>. My family and I moved to New Zealand in 2003 and after moving around for a while, we settled in sunny Nelson in 2009, where we have lived ever since.</p>
      
    <p class="text">I have always had a keen interest in code and computers, I always liked messing around in the inspect element tool and editing webpages. I first started coding with HTML and CSS back in 2014 in my digital technologies class at college and instantly found it was something I really enjoyed. Through-out the years though, I drifted away from coding and decided to focus more on finance and business.</p>
      
    <p class="text">After doing a year at Massey University doing a business degree, I realised that it simply was not something I really enjoyed or was passionate about, so I was back at square one wondering what I want to do. That's when I decided that getting into the tech industry is what I want to do. I didn't want to go back to a traditional university, so after looking online I came across Dev Academy, decided to enroll, and well hopefully the rest will be history!</p>
