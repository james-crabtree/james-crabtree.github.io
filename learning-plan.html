    <h1 class="text">CORE WEEK 2: My learning plan</h1> 
      <h3 class="text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="text">My long term goal and career aspirations is to get into the tech industry, initially in the web development industry, then see where life takes me. I’ve wanted to get into the tech industry for a long time because it is constantly growing, job opportunities are very high and I think will continue to remain high for a long long long time, and I also think that people working in tech are typically more valued and treated better by employers than in other traditional industries.</p><hr>

      <h3 class="text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p class="text">A huge limitation of mine when it comes to learning is my attention span. I have always had a very short attention span and my brain finds it hard to stay focused on mundane or long tasks for long periods of time. I also find that I get distracted very easily or that while working my brain will just wonder off and start thinking of completely different stuff.<br><br>
       A strength of mine when it comes to learning though is kind of the opposite to the weakness. When I find a topic or task that I really really really enjoy and find interesting, I will sit down for hours working on it, researching all about it, until I know everything there is to know about it.</p><hr>
      
      <br>
      <h3 class="text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p class="text">My time management skills. As stated above, I find it hard to do some tasks due to my short attention span and at times find it hard to remain focused. I think learning good time management skills will teach me ways in how to manage my time to get the most out of myself, teach me when I need to take breaks, and will help me ensure that I get projects completed on time.</p><hr>
      
      <br>
        <h3 class="text">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p class="text">Being kind and just generally being a good person to be around and working alongside I think is the key thing, cause no one wants to work alongside someone who is a massive dickhead. Also being honest when I’m finding stuff to tough, or when I am having problems, so then people can provide help and support.</p><hr> 
      
      <br>
      <h3 class="text">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p class="text">Step back and take a break. When things are starting to get me, trying to just push through or keep doing what I am doing very rarely works and actually ends up with me getting even more worked up and annoyed. So when things are starting to get to me I will step back, take a break, perhaps go outside and get some fresh air to clear my head, then I can come back to the computer with a clear head and continue to work through everything.</p><hr>
      
      <br>
      <h3 class="text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p class="text">If I can’t work out a problem or something after 10-15 minutes of trying to do it on my own, the first place I usually check is Google. Google is full of information and online forums and a lot of the time I find that there are other people in the world who have had the same problems I am facing and that solutions to those problems are posted online. If I can’t find a solution or any help on Google, then I’ll ask for help from my fellow students of a course facilitator.</p><hr>
      
      <br>
      <h3 class="text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p class="text">Just to be there when I’m stuck or requiring support on something. I understand this course will as time goes on become very tough and the facilitation team know better than most people how tough it is, so just knowing they’re there to support you and provide any help you may need is really what I would expect from them.</p><hr>
      
      <br>
      <h3 class="text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p class="text">No consistent commitments. Due to my health issues, I do have to do blood tests every month which takes up 1 morning every month. I also have occasional visits with my GP and specialist, and semi regular meetings with the dialysis nurses. I am currently going to counselling once a week which right now is my most consistent commitment, but times for those appointments are made to work around anything I have going on.</p><hr>
