    <h3 class="text">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      From an outsiders perspective, classes and id’s may look the same, they essentially both do the same thing - 
      they’re both used to edit elements with CSS, but taking a deeper closer look into the two, you’ll see that their uses are 
      different to each other. To put it into simple terms, you should use a class when you plan to use it on multiple elements (like 
      on a h1, p, h3, div) while you should use an id if you are only trying to edit a specific single element. 
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      To create a class, you decide a name for it with a . in front of it in your CSS file. In the example below, the classes name is 
      “red-text” and any text based elements that have this class added to it will be turned red. I’ll be able to add this class to as 
      many elements as I want.

    <p class="text">
      To add a class to an element you, not surprising, use the “class” tag. Again, you can add a class to as many different elements 
      as you want, like I have below. This will make the h1, h3, and p elements (only the ones with the class ‘red-text’) have red text.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      To create an id, you decide a name for it with a # in front of it. In the example below, the id’s name is #main-title and the 
      element that has this id will be turned blue and be underlined. I’ll add this id to a single element, in this case based on the 
      name, likely adding it to the main title element of the page.
    </p>

    <p class="text">IMAGE GOES HERE</p>

    <p class="text">
      To add an id to the element you use the “id” tag. Again, you should only add an id to a single element. Meaning if you want to 
      add the attributes of a certain id to more than 1 element, you’ll have to make a whole new id and copy and paste the attributes 
      into it. If you are wanting to add an id to multiple elements, then you should use a class instead.
