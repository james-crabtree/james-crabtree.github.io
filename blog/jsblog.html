    <h3 class="text">What is Javascript?</h3>
      <p class="text">What is Javascript? If you think of HTML as the bones of the human skeleton, CSS as the physical features of the body, then Javascript is like the organs and DNA that bring the whole body to life. Javascript is what takes any website to the next level, makes it interactive, and is what takes a website from good to great.</p>

    <h3 class="text">What is control flow and loops?</h3>

    <h3 class="text">What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p class="text">DOM may sound scary but it actually means <strong>Document Object Model</strong> and it is basically a programming interface for web developments.<br>
The DOM allows you to interact and manage aspects of your webpage straight from the console using Javascript inputs. It is mostly used as a way for programs to interact with your web pages and make them more interactive, dynamic, and of course just more appealing for the user.

    <h3 class="text">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
    <p class="text">Arrays and Objects are similar to each other but they’re both used at different times. Basically, arrays are best to use when the elements you are inputting are numbers, while objects are best to use when the elements are text, also known as strings. 
An array’s data is stored under a variable name and is stored in sequential, numeral order - starting from 0 since programmers are weird. Objects also stores their data under a variable name but each data is stored under a property - like ‘name’ or ‘age’ or ‘favColor’.

    <h3 class="text">What are functions?</h3>
    <p class="text">Functions are sets of code blocks which can easily be reused throughout your code on your website. Functions are basically instructions for the computer or program, it’s telling the program what it is wanting it to do. Functions are a great tool as you can create a function then easily use it throughout your code with minimal hassle. </p>
