      <p class="heading">TECHNICAL BLOG WEEK 4: Problem solving</p>
        <h3 class="text">What was a time I was blocked on a simple problem?</h3>
        <p class="text">
             Years ago when I was first starting coding in HTML and CSS I couldn’t for the life of me work out why one of my 
             classes wasn’t working. It was driving me insane but eventually I found out that the syntax I was using was 
             wrong, which is why it wasn’t working. To solve my problem I took a long hard look at the code and broke it 
             down into littles pieces until I finally found the problem. Ultimately this incident helped me learn a good way 
             to solve coding problems, by looking over the code and breaking it down into smaller pieces until you find the 
             problem. It also taught me the correct syntax too.

          <h3 class="text">What was a time I elegantly solved a problem?</h3>
          <p class="text">
             This is not about coding and truthfully it’s a bit silly, but I solved this problem with such elegance that I just have to 
             share it. Last night for dinner I made homemade burgers, as you do. I grab my bun, cut it up, put the patty on the bottom 
             bun, then piled it up with lettuce, this is where the problem started. When I went to pick up the tomato sauce to squirt 
             it on, the lettuce all fell off because it was stacked to high. Easy solution right? Just take off some of the lettuce, 
             but I couldn’t because this lettuce was soooo delicious. So I tried to squirt some on again and once again the lettuce 
             falls off. What was my elegant solution you ask? Well I squirted the tomato sauce on the top bun then put the top bun on 
             top of the burger, with no lettuce falling off! Amazing.

          <h3 class="text">How confident am I using these problem solving techniques?</h3>
            <ul class="text">
              <li><strong>Psuedocode:</strong> This is something I only learned this week during this sprint so isn’t something I have a lot of experience with. That said, it certainly looks easy enough to get good at, and definitely looks like a good and clear way to solve problems.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> This is another method I haven’t used a lot of but one I would feel confident using as it simply requires you to talk through the problem you got to yourself.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> My confidence on this one varies a lot. There are some error messages that I am very confident in using, and have no problems understanding them. But, there are also a lot of error messages out there that I have very little confidence in and don’t really understand them at all.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Pretty confident using this one, and it’s one I like using, since it basically allows you to instantly see in the console if what you’re doing is correct or not.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Googling:</strong> Quite confident using this method, I’ve used google for a long long long time and feel like I am quite skillful in using relevant search criterias to find what I’m looking for. I can always get better at it though.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Asking my peers for help:</strong> Very happy to do this as they are on the same journey as I am and may have even encountered the same problem I am dealing with, so will be able to provide me with first hand experience in helping me.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Very very happy to do this one as the coaches have a bucket load of experience and are literally here to help with any problems that we may encounter. They’re also all really nice and approachable so I have no worries about asking any question, no matter what it is.</li>
                <br>
              <li><strong>Improving my process with reflection:</strong> This is one I am less confident with, simply due to the fact I have never really used reflection techniques at all during any part of my life, though I am starting to use it more and more thanks to this course.</li>
