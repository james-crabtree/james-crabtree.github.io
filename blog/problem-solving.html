        <p class="text">
                        Years ago when I was first starting coding in HTML and CSS I couldn’t for the life of me work out why one of my 
                        classes wasn’t working. It was driving me insane but eventually I found out that the syntax I was using was 
                        wrong, which is why it wasn’t working. To solve my problem I took a long hard look at the code and broke it 
                        down into littles pieces until I finally found the problem. Ultimately this incident helped me learn a good way 
                        to solve coding problems, by looking over the code and breaking it down into smaller pieces until you find the 
                        problem. It also taught me the correct syntax too.
