    <h3 class="text">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      When you look up emotional intelligence on Google it will come up with this definition - <strong><i>“the capacity to be aware of, control, 
        and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically”.</i></strong> But what does that 
        actually mean?
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      To put it into more simple and more understandable terms, Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice, understand and manage your 
      emotions and the emotions of others around you, like your family, friends, colleagues. There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, 
      self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="text">
      <li><strong>Self awareness:</strong> This is the ability to recognise your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as your own emotions and your emotional intelligence level.</li>
      <li><strong>Self regulation:</strong> This is the ability to stay in control of your emotions and not make any rash or ill informed decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> This is your ability to set and achieve goals. How you push yourself towards achieving your goals, and how you keep yourself going in the right direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Your ability to care and show compassion for others. It’s your ability to understand the emotions of others and react accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Social skills:</strong> This is your ability to effectively communicate and interact with others, resolve any conflict, and build strong healthy relationships. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p class="text">\
      Another thing that is talked about a lot alongside emotional intelligence is <strong>“intelligence quotient”</strong> or IQ for short. IQ is 
      the level of a person’s emotional intelligence and is usually measured by a test which generates a score in the form of a number. So what is 
      the difference between IQ and EQ?
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Well, I’m glad you asked. IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is the measure of how well you can think logically in situations and how well you can 
      problem solve. EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is the measure of how well you are able to control and manage your emotions. A lot of people and 
      studies suggest that emotional intelligence usually will have a larger impact on your personal and professional life than intelligence 
      quotient.

   <h3 class="text">Why is EQ important?</h3>
   <p class="text">
    So, after all of that, why should I actually care about emotional intelligence and is it actually that important and relevant? Well I mean, if 
    you want to live a sad, empty life then you can just completely ignore emotional intelligence, but doing that would actually show you don’t 
    have a whole lot of emotional intelligence, which is ironic.
  </p>
   <p class="text">
    So why is emotional intelligence important and how much does it have an effect on our day to day lives?  
  </p>
   <p class="text">
    EQ is important because it helps you manage your emotions and helps you have better emotional health. It also helps you connect with others, 
    form stronger relationships, defuse negative situations, reduce stress in your personal and professional life, give you more satisfaction and 
    happiness in your personal and professional life. Essentially, emotional intelligence can affect a very large part of our life. If we develop 
    good EQ skills then that will generally lead to a healthier, happy, more fruitful personal and professional life for you.
