      <h3 class="text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        My long term goal and career aspirations is to get into the tech industry, initially in the web development industry, then see where life 
        takes me. I’ve wanted to get into the tech industry for a long time because it is constantly growing, job opportunities are very high and 
        I think will continue to remain high for a long long long time, and I also think that people working in tech are typically more valued and 
        treated better by employers than in other traditional industries.

      <h3 class="text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p class="text">
        A huge limitation of mine when it comes to learning is my attention span. I have always had a very short attention span and my brain finds 
        it hard to stay focused on mundane or long tasks for long periods of time. I also find that I get distracted very easily or that while 
        working my brain will just wonder off and start thinking of completely different stuff.<br><br>

        A strength of mine when it comes to learning though is kind of the opposite to the weakness. When I find a topic or task that I really 
        really really enjoy and find interesting, I will sit down for hours working on it, researching all about it, until I know everything there 
        is to know about it.

      <h3 class="text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        My time management skills. As stated above, I find it hard to do some tasks due to my short attention span and at times find it hard to 
        remain focused. I think learning good time management skills will teach me ways in how to manage my time to get the most out of myself, 
        teach me when I need to take breaks, and will help me ensure that I get projects completed on time.

      <h3 class="text">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Being kind and just generally being a good person to be around and working alongside I think is the key thing, cause no one wants to work 
        alongside someone who is a massive dickhead. Also being honest when I’m finding stuff to tough, or when I am having problems, so then 
        people can provide help and support.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Step back and take a break. When things are starting to get me, trying to just push through or keep doing what I am doing very rarely works
         and actually ends up with me getting even more worked up and annoyed. So when things are starting to get to me I will step back, take a 
         break, perhaps go outside and get some fresh air to clear my head, then I can come back to the computer with a clear head and continue to 
         work through everything.
      </p>
        <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p class="text">
        If I can’t work out a problem or something after 10-15 minutes of trying to do it on my own, the first place I usually check is Google. 
        Google is full of information and online forums and a lot of the time I find that there are other people in the world who have had the 
        same problems I am facing and that solutions to those problems are posted online. If I can’t find a solution or any help on Google, then 
        I’ll ask for help from my fellow students of a course facilitator.
      </p>
        <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Just to be there when I’m stuck or requiring support on something. I understand this course will as time goes on become very tough and the 
        facilitation team know better than most people how tough it is, so just knowing they’re there to support you and provide any help you may 
        need is really what I would expect from them.

      <h3 class="text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p class="text">
        No consistent commitments. Due to my health issues, I do have to do blood tests every month which takes up 1 morning every month. I also 
        have occasional visits with my GP and specialist, and semi regular meetings with the dialysis nurses. I am currently going to counselling 
        once a week which right now is my most consistent commitment, but times for those appointments are made to work around anything I have 
        going on.

      <p class="heading">CORE WEEK 5: My learning plan, revisited</p>
      <h3 class="text">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        My long term goal and plans since starting the Dev Academy course, and since answering this question back in week 2, has not changed. My
        long term goal continues to be to get a job in the technology industry, web development at first and then see where my life and the job can
        take me. Since going through the Dev Academy course, I have started to enjoy web development more and more, though currently I am struggling
        with Javascript still but I know I'll get there. I look forward to heading into bootcamp to further improve the skills I have learnt so far.

      <h3 class="text">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        A huge limitation of mine when it comes to learning is my attention span. I have always had a very short attention span and my brain finds 
        it hard to stay focused on mundane or long tasks for long periods of time. I also find that I get distracted very easily or that while 
        working my brain will just wonder off and start thinking of completely different stuff.<br><br>

        A strength of mine when it comes to learning though is kind of the opposite to the weakness. When I find a topic or task that I really

        is to know about it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        My biggest non-technical challenge that I think I will face in bootcamp will be keeping up my motivation and to continue pushing to get the
        work done. There have been some times through foundations where I have found it hard to keep myself motivated or focused on the work that I was
        needing to get done, which has made me fall behind which is something I can't afford at bootcamp. 
          <br>
        That being said, I believe bootcamp will be an environment where I will strive due to the more strict structure of the course, having a day by
        day schedule to follow, and having live lectures and stuff to follow.
      </p>
        <hr>

      <h3 class="text">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        My time management skills continue to be a non-technical skill that I want to continue to work on and improve while here at Dev Academy. 
        I also now hope to also improve my skills in project management, learn different ways of staying on task and staying focused on the task at
        hand to make sure I finish it on time and to a high standard.
          <br>
        I would also like to work on my skills and ability to work well in a team and a group environment, since I know that the web development and
        technlogy industry is very team orientated and knowing how to work well and effectively in a team will be an extremely valuable and employable
        skill for when I look for a job in the industry. 
      </p>
        <hr>

      <h3 class="text">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        To continue to provide support and help when needed and help guide myself, and of course all the other students, through the journey of
        bootcamp since we know it will be tough and a lot of work. 
      </p>
        <hr>

      <h3 class="text">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Get my shit a bit more in order. I will very honestly admit that there have been some times during foundations that I have been a bit to
        slack and haven't put in the amount of effort I want to put in, and expect from myself. I know that bootcamp will be much harder and more
        intense than foundations and that I can't afford to be slack and I got to give it my all - so my expectation of myself is to sort my shit out
        and go hard at bootcamp.
