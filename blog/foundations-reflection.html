    <h3 class="text">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

    <h3 class="text">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

    <h3 class="text">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

    <h3 class="text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      I found actually taking on the advice and stuff we learned from the core learning, and actually putting it into use in my day to day life
      and also when I am coding. A lot of the stuff I learnt during the core learning are absolutely very useful things to know, but a lot of it
      is stuff that I haven't practiced or used through my life.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      What I am trying to say is that I have already developed my own habits so I have found it a little difficult to take some of the stuff I've
      learned from the core learning and put it into practice, because some of the stuff we've learned is basically polar opposites to the habits
      I have already developed.
    </p>
      <br>

    <h3 class="text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Because having those core skills that we are being taught is something that a lot of employers in the programming/technology industry looks
      for in potential candiates to hire. Real world technology employers aren't just looking for people who can code well, with enough time and
      practice basically anyone can code well, they're also looking for people who can work efficiently, work well in a team and have good time
      management skills. This is why Dev Academy teaches us these core skills, to get us ready for work in the real world and to also make us look
      more attractive to potential employers.

    <h3 class="text">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p class="text">
      No, absolutely not. I suppose a lot of people just think that working as a programmer is all about writing code, and while that is pretty 
      true, there is a whole lot more to it than that, such as problem solving, working to strict deadlines, working in a team, and keeping your 
      cool when shit just isn’t going right. This is where the core learning comes in, knowing how to program is essential as a programmer but so 
      are the other core things so I certainly don’t think it is a waste of time to be studying the core learnings.
